Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Model
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various factors such as age, sex, ticket class, and more. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. The dataset includes personal details about passengers such as:

Passenger class
Gender
Age
Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Number of parents/children aboard
Fare paid
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms to accurately predict survival based on these features.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following files:

train.csv: Training dataset containing information about passengers and whether they survived or not.
test.csv: Test dataset for evaluating the model.
Key features in the dataset:

Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Sex: Gender
Age: Age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Passenger fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and more models

Modeling Approach
We explore multiple machine learning models to find the best one for predicting survival:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data visualization to uncover relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
Model Selection: Training and evaluating different models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb
Usage
To predict survival using the pre-trained model:

Load the trained model from the models/ directory.
Preprocess your test data (handle missing values, feature encoding, etc.).
Use the model to predict survival:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.externals import joblib
model = joblib.load('models/logistic_regression.pkl')
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
